# CHAT GPT CODE ELABORATION 

Below is a detailed, beginner-friendly explanation of your project code. I’ve broken it into sections so you can understand what each part does. Some parts have been simplified for clarity.

---

## 1. Setting Up Google Generative AI  
**What it does:**  
• Installs the Google Generative AI package and sets up your API key.  
• Lists available models for later use.

**Code Explanation:**
- **Installation and Import:**  
  ```python
  !pip install -Uq google-generativeai   
  import google.generativeai as genai
  ```
  *This installs the package and then imports it for use.*

- **API Key Configuration:**  
  ```python
  from google.colab import userdata
  genai.configure(api_key=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY'))
  ```
  *This retrieves your API key from Colab’s userdata and configures the library to use it.*

- **List Models:**  
  ```python
  list(genai.list_models())
  ```
  *This command retrieves and displays the available models you can work with.*  
  *(For more details on models, see Google’s Generative AI documentation citeturn0search0.)*

---

## 2. Creating Embeddings with Google Generative AI  
**What it does:**  
• Calls the API to generate embeddings (vector representations) for text.  
• First, it embeds a single string; then, it embeds a list of strings.

**Code Explanation:**
- **Embedding a Single String:**  
  ```python
  from typing import Dict

  result: Dict = genai.embed_content(
      model="models/text-embedding-004",
      content="What is he meaning of life",
      task_type="RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT",
      title="Embedding of single string"
  )
  result["embedding"]
  len(result["embedding"])
  ```
  *Here, you use the `embed_content` function to convert the text into a list of numbers (a vector). The `task_type` helps specify how the embedding will be used (here, for document retrieval), and a title is provided for context.*

- **Embedding a List of Strings:**  
  ```python
  result: Dict = genai.embed_content(
      model="models/text-embedding-004",
      content=["""What is the meaning of Life?
                 Who can we become a true Muslim?
                 How does our brain work?"""],
      task_type="RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT",
      title="Embedding of a list of string",
  )
  for v in result["embedding"]:
    print(v[:5], len(v))
  ```
  *In this block, the code embeds a block of text (presented as a list with one string) and then prints the first five numbers of each resulting embedding along with its length.*

---

## 3. Installing LangChain and Chroma  
**What it does:**  
• Installs LangChain libraries and Chroma for vector storage.  
• Sets up the environment for document processing.

**Code Explanation:**
- **Installation:**  
  ```python
  !pip install -Uq langchain
  !pip install -Uq langchain-chroma
  ```
  *This installs LangChain (a framework for building LLM applications) and its Chroma integration (a vector database).*

- **Importing Required Modules:**  
  ```python
  import getpass
  import os
  from langchain_core.documents import Document
  ```
  *These modules help handle system tasks and document creation.*

---

## 4. Creating Document Objects  
**What it does:**  
• Creates multiple `Document` objects—each representing a piece of text along with metadata.

**Code Explanation:**
- **Document Creation:**  
  ```python
  document_1 = Document(
      page_content="I had chocolate chip pancakes and scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning.",
      metadata={"source": "tweet"},
  )
  # Similar blocks are repeated for document_2 through document_10.
  ```
  *Each document is created with the actual text (`page_content`) and a metadata tag (like "tweet" or "news"). This helps in later filtering or understanding the source of the text.*

---

## 5. Using Google AI Embeddings with LangChain  
**What it does:**  
• Sets up the Google Generative AI embeddings in LangChain using the **langchain-google-genai** package.  
• Tests the embeddings with a query.

**Code Explanation:**
- **Installation and Import:**  
  ```python
  !pip install -Uq langchain-google-genai
  from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings
  ```
  *This installs the integration package and imports the embeddings class.*

- **Instantiating the Embeddings Object:**  
  ```python
  embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(
      model="models/text-embedding-004",
      google_api_key=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
  )
  ```
  *This creates an embeddings object using the same model as before and your API key.*

- **Embedding a Query:**  
  ```python
  embeddings.embed_query("Tell me about Life")
  len(embeddings.embed_query("Tell me about Life"))
  embeddings.embed_query("Tell me about Life")[:5]
  ```
  *This demonstrates how to embed a query string and inspect the output vector.*

---

## 6. Building a Vectorstore with Chroma  
**What it does:**  
• Uses the Chroma vector store to index the documents.  
• Allows similarity searches over these document embeddings.

**Code Explanation:**
- **Creating the Vectorstore:**  
  ```python
  from langchain_chroma import Chroma
  vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
      documents=[document_1, document_2, document_3, document_4, document_5, document_6, document_7, document_8, document_9, document_10],
      embedding=embeddings
  )
  ```
  *This command builds a vector database from your documents using the embeddings for each document.*

- **Exploring the Vectorstore and Searching:**  
  ```python
  dir(vectorstore)
  vectorstore
  vectorstore.similarity_search("Tell me about the LangGraph")
  await vectorstore.asimilarity_search("Tell me about the LangGraph")
  vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score("Tell me about the LangGraph")
  embedding = embeddings.embed_query("Tell me about the LangGaraph")
  vectorstore.similarity_search_by_vector(embedding)
  embedding[:10]
  len(embedding)
  ```
  *These lines show different ways to explore the vectorstore and perform similarity searches. You can search by query text or directly by vector.*

*For more on Chroma and LangChain’s vectorstore capabilities, refer to the LangChain documentation citeturn0search1.*

## 7. Creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline  
**What it does:**  
• Combines document retrieval with a language model to answer questions using the retrieved context.  
• Builds a chain that uses a prompt template, retrieval function, and chat model.

**Code Explanation:**
- **Setting Up the Retriever:**  
  ```python
  from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
  retrieve = RunnableLambda(vectorstore.similarity_search).bind(k=1)
  retrieve.batch(["LangGraph"])
  ```
  *A `RunnableLambda` wraps the vectorstore’s similarity search so it can be used in a processing chain. Here, it’s set to return the top (k=1) result.*

- **Creating a Chat Model:**  
  ```python
  from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

  llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
      model="gemini-1.5-flash",
      temperature=1.0,
      api_key=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
  )
  llm.invoke("Tell me about Allama Iqbal")
  ```
  *This initializes a chat-based language model (using Google’s Gemini model) to generate text responses.*

- **Building the Prompt Template:**  
  ```python
  from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
  from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

  message = """
  Answer this questoin using the provided context only.

  {question}

  Context:
  {context}
  """
  prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([("human", message)])
  ```
  *A prompt template is created. This instructs the model to answer a question using the given context.*

- **Creating the RAG Chain:**  
  ```python
  from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableMap
  rag_chain = RunnableMap({
      "context": retrieve,
      "question": RunnableLambda(lambda x: x)  # identity function to pass the question through
  }) | prompt | llm
  ```
  *Here, the retrieval function (to get context) and a simple lambda (passing the question) are combined using `RunnableMap`. The output is piped (using the `|` operator) into the prompt and then into the language model.*

- **Invoking the Chain and Getting Responses:**  
  ```python
  response = rag_chain.invoke("Tell me about Quaid e Azam")
  print(response.content)
  response = rag_chain.invoke("Tell me about LangGraph")
  print(response.content)
  ```
  *Finally, the chain is run with specific questions. The model returns answers that use the retrieved context to form a response.*

*This entire RAG pipeline is an example of combining retrieval (using embeddings and vectorstores) with generative models to build a smart question-answering system.*

---

# DEEPSEEK CODE ELABORATION 
---

Okay, let's see. The user provided their project code and wants an explanation of each part, especially since they're a beginner. I need to break down the code step by step in simple terms.

First, the code starts with installing the Google Generative AI library. I should explain what this does—probably for accessing Gemini models. Then they import the necessary modules and configure the API key using Colab's userdata. That makes sense for security.

Next, they list the available models. I should mention that this helps check if the API is working and which models they can use. Then there's the embedding part. They use genai.embed_content with a specific model. The first example is a single string, then a list of strings. The output shows embeddings, which are vectors. I need to explain what embeddings are and why they're used, maybe with a simple analogy.

Installing LangChain and Chroma comes next. LangChain is for building LLM applications, and Chroma is a vector database. The documents are created with page_content and metadata. Each document has a source, like tweet or news. This is sample data for the vector store.

Then they set up the GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings, which connects to the same embedding model. Testing the embedding on a query and checking its length and a slice. This shows how each text is converted into a numerical vector.

Creating the Chroma vector store with from_documents. This stores all the document embeddings. They then do similarity searches, which retrieve relevant documents based on the query's embedding. The async method might be for handling multiple requests, but since they're a beginner, maybe just mention it's for asynchronous operations.

Using RunnableLambda and creating a retriever that fetches the top 1 document. Then setting up the LLM with Gemini-1.5-flash, higher temperature for creativity. The prompt template instructs using only the provided context. The RAG chain combines retrieval, prompt, and LLM to generate answers.

Testing the chain with queries. For "Quaid e Azam", there's no context, so the answer is wrong. For "LangGraph", it finds the relevant document and generates a proper response. I should highlight why one works and the other doesn't, based on the sample data.

I need to ensure each part is explained clearly, avoid jargon, and relate concepts to real-world examples. Check if any steps might be confusing, like async functions or metadata handling. Emphasize the flow: setup, data preparation, embedding, vector storage, retrieval, and generation. Also, note possible typos like "LangGaraph" affecting results. Offer suggestions for improvement, like more data or error handling.

---

### **2. Checking Available Models**
```python
list(genai.list_models())
```
- **What it does:** Lists all AI models you can use
- **Example Output:** Shows names like `gemini-pro` (for text) and `text-embedding-004` (for converting text to numbers)

---

### **3. Text Embeddings (Converting Words to Numbers)**
```python
# For single text
result = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/text-embedding-004",
    content="What is the meaning of life",
    task_type="RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT"
)
print(len(result["embedding"]))  # Output: 768 numbers

# For multiple texts
result = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/text-embedding-004",
    content=["Text1", "Text2", "Text3"]
)
```
- **What it does:** Converts text into a list of 768 numbers (called "embeddings")
- **Beginner Note:** Like translating words into a secret number code computers understand

---

### **4. Creating Sample Documents**
```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

document_1 = Document(
    page_content="I had pancakes...",
    metadata={"source": "tweet"}
)
# ... (document_2 to document_10)
```
- **What it does:** Creates 10 example "documents" with:
  - `page_content`: Actual text
  - `metadata`: Extra info (like where it came from)
- **Beginner Note:** These are like index cards with information you want your AI to remember

---

### **5. Setting Up Embeddings System**
```python
from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings
embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(
    model="models/text-embedding-004",
    google_api_key=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
)
```
- **What it does:** Creates a tool to convert text ➔ numbers using Google's system
- **Test:** `embeddings.embed_query("Tell me about Life")` gives 768 numbers

---

### **6. Creating a Memory Bank (Vector Store)**
```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=[document_1, document_2, ...],
    embedding=embeddings
)
```
- **What it does:** Stores all documents as number codes (embeddings) in a searchable database
- **Beginner Note:** Like creating a library where books are arranged by their "number codes"

---

### **7. Searching the Memory Bank**
```python
# Find similar documents
vectorstore.similarity_search("Tell me about LangGraph")

# Search with scores
vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score("...")

# Search using number code directly
embedding = embeddings.embed_query("...")
vectorstore.similarity_search_by_vector(embedding)
```
- **What it does:** Finds documents similar to your query
- **Example:** Searching "LangGraph" finds document_8 about LangGraph

---

### **8. Setting Up the AI Brain (LLM)**
```python
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model="gemini-1.5-flash",
    temperature=1.0
)
```
- **What it does:** Creates an AI chatbot that can answer questions
- **Temperature=1.0:** Makes answers more creative (0 = strict, 1 = imaginative)

---

### **9. Creating the Question-Answer System**
```python
# Step 1: Create a prompt template
message = """
Answer using context only:
{question}
Context: {context}
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([("human", message)])

# Step 2: Connect all parts
rag_chain = RunnableMap({
    "context": retrieve,  # Search tool
    "question": ...       # Your question
}) | prompt | llm
```
- **What it does:** Creates a pipeline that:
  1. Searches your documents
  2. Formats the question
  3. Sends to AI for answering

---

### **10. Testing the System**
```python
response = rag_chain.invoke("Tell me about LangGraph")
print(response.content)
```
- **Good Query:** "LangGraph" finds document_8 → Good answer
- **Bad Query:** "Quaid e Azam" → No matching document → Wrong answer

---

### **Key Concepts for Beginners**
1. **Embeddings:** Text ➔ Numbers (for computer understanding)
2. **Vector Store:** Database of number-coded documents
3. **Retrieval:** Finding similar documents
4. **LLM:** AI that generates answers
5. **RAG Chain:** Combines all steps into one system

### **Common Issues to Note**
- Typos matter: "LangGaraph" ≠ "LangGraph"
- Needs relevant documents to answer correctly
- `temperature=1.0` makes answers more random
