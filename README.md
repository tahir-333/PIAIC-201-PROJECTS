# CHAT GPT PROJECT CODE ELABORATOIN
Below is a step-by-step explanation of your code, breaking down what each segment does:

---

## 1. Installing Required Packages

```python
!pip install -Uq langchain-pinecone
!pip install -Uq langchain-google-genai
```

- **`!pip install`**: The exclamation mark indicates that these are shell commands meant for a notebook (like Google Colab or Jupyter).  
- **`-U` flag**: Upgrades the package to the latest version if it’s already installed.  
- **`-q` flag**: Runs the installation in quiet mode (minimal output).  
- **Packages Installed**:  
  - **`langchain-pinecone`**: Integrates LangChain with Pinecone, a vector database for storing and querying high-dimensional data (embeddings).  
  - **`langchain-google-genai`**: Connects LangChain with Google’s generative AI services, allowing you to leverage Google’s advanced text processing models.

---

## 2. Setting Up Pinecone

### a. Importing Modules and Retrieving API Key

```python
from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec
from google.colab import userdata

pinecone_api_key = userdata.get('PINECONE_API_KEY')
pc = Pinecone(api_key=pinecone_api_key)
```

- **Imports**:  
  - `Pinecone` and `ServerlessSpec` are imported to interact with Pinecone, including its serverless mode settings.  
  - `userdata` from `google.colab` is used to securely access your API keys.
- **API Key Retrieval**:  
  - `userdata.get('PINECONE_API_KEY')` retrieves your Pinecone API key from Colab’s secure storage.
- **Client Initialization**:  
  - `pc = Pinecone(api_key=pinecone_api_key)` creates a Pinecone client instance using your API key.

### b. Deleting an Existing Index (if necessary)

```python
index_to_delete = "rag-project"  # Replace with the name of the index you want to delete
pc.delete_index('rag-project')
```

- **Purpose**:  
  - This removes any existing index named `"rag-project"`. It’s useful if you need to start fresh or avoid conflicts.

### c. Creating a New Pinecone Index

```python
import time

index_name = "rag-project-1"  # Change the index name if desired

pc.create_index(
    name=index_name,
    dimension=768,
    metric="cosine",
    spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-east-1"),
)
index = pc.Index(index_name)
```

- **Index Name**:  
  - `index_name` is set to `"rag-project-1"`. You can choose any name.
- **Creating the Index**:  
  - `pc.create_index(...)` creates a new index in Pinecone with the following parameters:  
    - **`dimension=768`**: The expected size of the embedding vectors.  
    - **`metric="cosine"`**: Specifies cosine similarity as the distance metric for comparisons.  
    - **`spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-east-1")`**: Indicates that the index should be created in AWS’s serverless environment in the `us-east-1` region.
- **Index Reference**:  
  - `index = pc.Index(index_name)` gets a reference to your newly created index for further operations.

---

## 3. Setting Up Google Generative AI Embeddings

### a. Importing and Configuring the Embedding Model

```python
from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings
import os
os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/text-embedding-004")
```

- **Import**:  
  - `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` is imported to work with Google’s embedding models.
- **API Key Setup**:  
  - The Google API key is retrieved from Colab’s user data and set as an environment variable (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`), which the model will use to authenticate.
- **Embedding Model Initialization**:  
  - The embeddings object is created using the specified model (in this case, `"models/text-embedding-004"`).

### b. Testing the Embedding Generation

```python
vector = embeddings.embed_query("hello, world!")
vector
```

- **Generate Embedding**:  
  - `embeddings.embed_query("hello, world!")` converts the query text into a vector embedding.
- **Output**:  
  - The resulting `vector` is displayed, confirming that the embedding process works correctly.

---

## 4. Creating a Pinecone Vector Store

```python
from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore

vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(index=index, embedding=embeddings)
```

- **Import**:  
  - `PineconeVectorStore` is imported from LangChain’s Pinecone integration.
- **Initialize Vector Store**:  
  - The `vector_store` is set up with the Pinecone index created earlier and the Google embeddings model. This store will handle the addition of documents (as vectors) and similarity searches.

---

## 5. Creating and Managing Documents

### a. Creating Document Objects

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

document_1 = Document(
    page_content="I had chocalate chip pancakes and scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning.",
    metadata={"source": "tweet"},
)
```

- **Document Creation**:  
  - A `Document` object is instantiated with `page_content` (the main text) and `metadata` (providing context, such as the source type).

### b. Creating Multiple Documents

The code then defines several documents (from `document_1` to `document_10`) with varying content and metadata:

```python
from uuid import uuid4

document_1 = Document(
    page_content="I had chocalate chip pancakes and scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning.",
    metadata={"source": "tweet"},
)

document_2 = Document(
    page_content="The weather forecast for tomorrow is cloudy and overcast, with a high of 62 degrees.",
    metadata={"source": "news"},
)

document_3 = Document(
    page_content="Building an exciting new project with LangChain - come check it out!",
    metadata={"source": "tweet"},
)

document_4 = Document(
    page_content="Robbers broke into the city bank and stole $1 million in cash.",
    metadata={"source": "news"},
)

document_5 = Document(
    page_content="Wow! That was an amazing movie. I can't wait to see it again.",
    metadata={"source": "tweet"},
)

document_6 = Document(
    page_content="Is the new iPhone worth the price? Read this review to find out.",
    metadata={"source": "website"},
)

document_7 = Document(
    page_content="The top 10 soccer players in the world right now.",
    metadata={"source": "website"},
)

document_8 = Document(
    page_content="LangGraph is the best framework for building stateful, agentic applications!",
    metadata={"source": "tweet"},
)

document_9 = Document(
    page_content="The stock market is down 500 points today due to fears of a recession.",
    metadata={"source": "news"},
)

document_10 = Document(
    page_content="I have a bad feeling I am going to get deleted :(",
    metadata={"source": "tweet"},
)

documents = [
    document_1,
    document_2,
    document_3,
    document_4,
    document_5,
    document_6,
    document_7,
    document_8,
    document_9,
    document_10,
]
len(documents)
```

- **Document List**:  
  - All created documents are stored in the list `documents`.
- **Counting Documents**:  
  - `len(documents)` returns the number of documents (which should be 10).

### c. Generating Unique Identifiers

```python
uuids = [str(uuid4()) for _ in range(len(documents))]
```

- **Purpose**:  
  - Generates a unique UUID for each document. These IDs are used when adding documents to the vector store to uniquely identify each entry.

---

## 6. Adding Documents to the Vector Store

```python
vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents, ids=uuids)
```

- **Operation**:  
  - This command adds each document along with its corresponding unique identifier to the Pinecone vector store.  
- **What Happens Internally**:  
  - The `vector_store` uses the Google embeddings model to convert each document’s text into a vector and then stores these vectors in the Pinecone index for later similarity search operations.

---

## 7. Performing Similarity Searches

### a. Similarity Search with a Filter

```python
results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    "LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy",
    k=2,
    filter={"source": "tweet"},
)
for res in results:
    print(f"* {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]")
```

- **Query**:  
  - The search query is `"LangChain provides abstractions to make working with LLMs easy"`.
- **Parameters**:  
  - **`k=2`**: Retrieve the top 2 most similar documents.
  - **Filter**: Only documents with metadata where `"source"` is `"tweet"` are considered.
- **Output**:  
  - The code loops over the results and prints each document’s content along with its metadata.

### b. Similarity Search with Scores

```python
results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(
    "Will it be hot tomorrow?"  # , k=1, filter={"source": "news"}
)
for res, score in results:
    print(f"* [SIM={score:3f}] {res.page_content} [{res.metadata}]")
```

- **Functionality**:  
  - This search returns not only the matching documents but also a similarity score indicating how close the match is.
- **Query**:  
  - The search query here is `"Will it be hot tomorrow?"`.
- **Optional Parameters**:  
  - You can specify `k` (number of documents) and filters (e.g., for `"news"`) as needed. In this snippet, these parameters are commented out.
- **Output**:  
  - Each result’s similarity score is printed alongside its page content and metadata, providing insight into the relevance of each match.

---

## Summary

1. **Setup**:  
   - Installs necessary packages for integrating LangChain with Pinecone and Google GenAI.
   - Retrieves API keys from the secure Colab environment.

2. **Pinecone Index Management**:

# DEEPSEEK PROJECT CODE ELABORATOIN 

Okay, let's try to figure out what this code is doing step by step. First, I see that the user is installing some packages: langchain-pinecone and langchain-google-genai. So they're probably using Pinecone for vector storage and Google's Generative AI for embeddings.

Then they import Pinecone and ServerlessSpec from the pinecone module. They're getting the Pinecone API key from Google Colab's userdata. Then they create a Pinecone instance with the API key. Next, they delete an existing index called 'rag-project'. Maybe they want to start fresh or recreate the index with new settings.
After deleting, they create a new index named 'rag-project-1' with a dimension of 768, cosine metric, and serverless spec on AWS in us-east-1. The dimension 768 suggests they're using an embedding model that outputs 768-dimensional vectors, like the Google text-embedding-004 model mentioned later.

Then they import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings and set the API key from userdata. They initialize the embeddings model with 'text-embedding-004' and test it by embedding "hello, world!" which probably returns a 768-dimensional vector.
Next, they set up a PineconeVectorStore from langchain_pinecone, linking the index and embeddings. This is where they'll store their document vectors.

They create a list of Document objects from langchain_core.documents. Each document has page_content and metadata indicating the source (tweet, news, website). There are 10 documents, each with different content. The UUIDs are generated for each document, likely to uniquely identify them in the vector store.

They add these documents to the vector store using add_documents, passing the documents and UUIDs. This should chunk the texts (if needed), generate embeddings, and upload them to Pinecone.
Finally, they perform two similarity searches. The first looks for documents similar to "LangChain provides abstractions..." with k=2 and a filter for source "tweet". The second search is for "Will it be hot tomorrow?" without a filter, using similarity_search_with_score to get both the results and their similarity scores.

Possible issues: The code runs in a Colab notebook, uses specific API keys stored in userdata, and assumes the correct permissions. The UUIDs might be redundant if Pinecone auto-generates IDs, but explicitly providing them ensures control. The filter in the first query ensures only tweets are considered. The second query checks all sources. The dimension in the index must match the embedding model's output (768 for text-embedding-004), which it does here. The use of ServerlessSpec suggests they're using Pinecone's serverless offering, which handles scaling automatically.

Let me break down the code step by step:

1. **Dependencies Installation**
```python
!pip install -Uq langchain-pinecone
!pip install -Uq langchain-google-genai
```
- Installs the latest versions of Pinecone and Google AI integrations for LangChain

2. **Pinecone Setup**
```python
from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec
pc = Pinecone(api_key=pinecone_api_key)
```
- Initializes Pinecone client using API key from Colab secrets
- Deletes old index named 'rag-project' to start fresh

3. **Index Creation**
```python
pc.create_index(
    name=index_name,
    dimension=768,
    metric="cosine",
    spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-east-1"),
)
```
- Creates new serverless index with:
  - 768 dimensions (matches Google's embedding model)
  - Cosine similarity metric
  - AWS hosting in us-east-1 region

4. **Embedding Model Setup**
```python
embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/text-embedding-004")
```
- Initializes Google's text embedding model (version 004)

5. **Vector Store Initialization**
```python
vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(index=index, embedding=embeddings)
```
- Creates LangChain-Pinecone integration object for storing/querying vectors

6. **Document Preparation**
```python
documents = [
    Document(page_content="...", metadata={"source": "tweet"}),
    # ... 9 more documents
]
```
- Creates 10 sample documents with:
  - Different content types (tweets, news, website content)
  - Metadata indicating source
  - Varied topics (tech, finance, sports, etc)

7. **Document Ingestion**
```python
uuids = [str(uuid4()) for _ in range(len(documents))]
vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents, ids=uuids)
```
- Generates unique UUIDs for each document
- Adds documents to Pinecone with:
  - Automatic text embedding using Google's model
  - Vector storage in the Pinecone index

8. **Query Examples**
```python
# Filtered search
results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    "LangChain...", 
    k=2,
    filter={"source": "tweet"}
)

# Scored search
results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(
    "Will it be hot tomorrow?"
)
```
- First query finds 2 most relevant tweets about LangChain
- Second query shows raw similarity scores for weather-related content

**Key Flow:**
1. Setup cloud infrastructure (Pinecone)
2. Prepare embedding model (Google AI)
3. Create vector storage system
4. Process and store documents
5. Query the knowledge base

**Important Notes:**
- Uses serverless Pinecone for scalable vector storage
- Leverages Google's cutting-edge embedding model
- Demonstrates metadata filtering capabilities
- Shows both simple and scored search variants
- Designed for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications

This implementation creates a fully functional vector search system that could be used as the retrieval component in a RAG pipeline.
